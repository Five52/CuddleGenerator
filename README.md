# Cuddle Generator

This project is a website providing pleasant messages to its users. An user can create an account, write pleasant messages or "cuddles" for users and receive "cuddles" on the website and by mail.
There is an administration platform to edit, validate or delete suggested cuddles.

This project was created during the first year of my master degree as a medium to make my first steps with Symfony 3 thus getting to know and understanding the basics of the framework.
